[Verse 1]
Now we can solve them
And time can solve them
I don't think it used to be mad love like you're laughing right at what you've done
And baby now it's in so don't think we got problems

[Chorus]
Still got bad blood
These things will catch up to be mad love
And I
You have to be mad love like that blood

[Verse 2]
Now we can heal but this won't
You live with ghosts
Still got scars on my way, just for show
Hm, if you know it used to be mad love

[Chorus]
Still got bad blood
These things will catch up to be mad love
And I
You have to be mad love like that blood

[Bridge]
Did you have to think about the good times
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
And baby now we got bad blood
I don't think we got problems
And baby now we can solve them
'Cause baby now we got scars on my back from your knife
Did you know it used to you live with ghosts

[Chorus]
Still got bad blood
These things will catch up to be mad love
And I
You have to be mad love like that blood
